# UnoDeck
A simple uno prefab. It only contains half of the deck, it needs to be doubled to have the full deck. This is just the card models and nothing more.
This is my first prefab I am sharing so please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve the sharing process, thank you and happy coding :)

To use this prefab, import it and scale it to your desired size. You will also need to make a copy to get the entire deck.
